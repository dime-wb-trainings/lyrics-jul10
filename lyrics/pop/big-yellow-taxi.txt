They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Ooh, bop-bop-bop
Ooh, bop-bop-bop (na-na-na-na-na)
They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum
And they charged the people a dollar and a half to see them
No, no, no
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot
Ooh, bop-bop-bop
Ooh, bop-bop-bop (oh-oh, na-na-na-na-na)
Hey, farmer, farmer, put away your DDT
I don't care about spots on my apples
Leave me the birds and the bees
Please!
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Hey, now, they paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Ooh, bop-bop-bop (why not?)
Ooh, bop-bop-bop
Listen, late last night, I heard the screen door sway
And a big yellow taxi took my girl away
Now, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Hey, now, now, don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you got 'til it's gone?
They paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Why not? They paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Hey, hey, hey, paved paradise to put up a parking lot
Ooh, bop-bop-bop
Ooh, bop-bop-bop
I don't wanna give it, why you wanna give it?
Why you wanna give it all away? Hey, hey, hey
Now you wanna give it, ah, she wanna give it
'Cause she's giving it all away, now, now
I don't wanna give it, why you wanna give it?
Why you wanna give it all away?
'Cause you're giving it all, giving it all away, yeah, yeah
Why d'you want me?
Why do you want to...? (She's giving it all away, hey, hey, hey)
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Hey, paved paradise to put up a parking lot
La-la, la-la-la, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
